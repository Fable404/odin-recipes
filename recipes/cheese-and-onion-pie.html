    <h3>What Makes a good pie?</h3>
    <p>The secret to a good cheese and onion pie is simplicity. No herbs, no potatoes... just cheese and onion</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>500g grated cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>500g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>300g cold butter, diced</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Step by step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>For the pastry, put the flour, butter and a pinch of salt in the food processor; pulse until it looks like breadcrumbs.</p>
            <p>Add 5-6 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing until it clumps into a ball.</p>
            <p>Wrap in clingfim; chill for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you have a microwave, put the onions in a heatproof bowl with 3 tablespoons of water.</p>
            <p>Cover and cook for 8-10 minutes on high, stirring halfway through, until very soft.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, put the onion and water in a pan and cook for 10-15 minutes until tender.</p>
            <p>Leave to cool, then drain off any excess water.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat the oven to 200 'C, fan 180 'C, gas 6. Mix together the cooled onions and cheese.</p>
            <p>Season generously with black pepper and a little salt.</p>
            <p>Lightly beat together 2 eggs, add to the cheese, and mix well. Cut off one-third of the pastry and chill.</p>
            <p>Roll out the larger ball on a floured surface. Use to line a shallow pie dish, about 25cm x 6cm. </p>
            <p>The pastry is quite short, so patch it up, if needed. Trim the edges</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pack in the filling, and smooth over the top. Roll out the remaining pastry until the thickness of a pound coin. </p>
            <p>Beat the remaining egg, and brush a little onto the lip of the dish, then lay the pastry on top, sealing the edges</p>
            <p>Trim off the edges and crimp , or press down with a fork, and make a steam hole. Brush with the remaining beaten egg.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
